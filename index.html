    <p>The Law’ is not a mystical animal, rather it is a living reality that every human being has to engage with. It only makes sense if the law is simple enough for a lay-person to understand, comprehend, and engage with ease. But the lack of legal awareness, the legalese in which most laws are couched, the difficulty in accessing laws because of language barriers, are some of the factors that lead to the mystification of the legal system, thereby creating a barrier to access to justice</p>
